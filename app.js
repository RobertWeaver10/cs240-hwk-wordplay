console.log("hello world")

//what do we need to do to create game?
// 1) get a word from the dictionary array that is 6 letters long
// 2) go through and find all possible words from subsets of letters that are at least 3 letters long
    // would be good to save all possible words to array. would take awhile at start of game but make for smooth gameplay
// 3) display the root word at the top of the console with letters scrambled
// 4) display the list of sub words with the letters hidden by "-"
// 5) game loop that continuously prompts users for input and will alert user of state of their guess
